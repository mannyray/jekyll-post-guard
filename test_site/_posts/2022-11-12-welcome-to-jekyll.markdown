In this post I have included the lock below which is a simple math quiz, demonstrating that you can require a base level of knowledge before someone consuming your article. If you complete the quiz correctly, you will get to see an image.

In addition, this posts info, in markdown, includes the `locked: true`:

It is not necessary to set `locked: true`, if you are using a lock.

<!--lock_start-->
<!--lock:{"data":"basic"}-->
