Traditionally, the `jekyll-post-guard` plugin has to phases: (1) intro followed by the (2) activity. The intro is meant to be an introduction/warning about the incoming activity. Sometimes, no warning is needed and we can start with the activity right away. Furthemore, the activity can also be interactive...like a game. Beat the game to unlock content.
